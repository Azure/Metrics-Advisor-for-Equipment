# Setting up your Azure account

Before you can start with Metrics-Advisor-for-Equipment, you must sign up for an Azure account if you don't already have one.

### To create an Azure account

Open [Azure Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services).

Follow the online instructions.

Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad.

### To create a Metrics Advisor for Equipment resource

When you have your Azure subscription, create a [Metrics Advisor](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2142156) resource in the Azure portal to deploy your instance of Metrics Advisor.


### Sign in to your workspace

After your resource is created, sign in to the Metrics Advisor portal with your Active Directory account. From the landing page, select your Directory, Subscription, and Workspace that you just created, and then select Get started. 

Currently you can create one Metrics Advisor resource at each available region. You can switch workspaces in the Metrics Advisor portal at any time.


> **_NOTE:_**  It can take 10 to 30 minutes for your Metrics Advisor resource to deploy. Select Go to resource after it successfully deploys.
If you want to use the REST API to interact with the service, you need the key and endpoint from the resource you create. You can find them on the Keys and endpoints tab in the created resource.
