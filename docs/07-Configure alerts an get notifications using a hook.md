After an anomaly is detected by Metrics Advisor for Equipment, an alert notification will be triggered based on alert setting using a hook. 

## 1. Create a hook

Currently, Metrics Advisor for Equipment supports only one type of hook: **Webhook.**

A Webhook is the entry point for all the information available from the Metrics Advisor service, and calls a user-provided API when an alert is triggered. All alerts can be sent through a Webhook.
