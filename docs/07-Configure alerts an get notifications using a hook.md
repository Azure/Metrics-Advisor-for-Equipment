After an anomaly is detected by Metrics Advisor for Equipment, an alert notification will be triggered based on alert setting using a hook. 

## 1. Create a hook

Currently, Metrics Advisor for Equipment supports only one type of hook: **Webhook.**

A Webhook is the entry point for all the information available from the Metrics Advisor service, and calls a user-provided API when an alert is triggered. All alerts can be sent through a Webhook.

To create a Webhook, you will need to add the following information:

| Parameter           | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Endpoint            | The API address to be called when an alert is triggered.     |
| Username / Password | For authenticating to the API address. Leave this black if authentication isn't needed. |
| Header              | Custom headers in the API call.                              |

After creating, you get a hook list.
